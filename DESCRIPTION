Description: 
  The SPLIT (Spatial Purification of Layered Intracellular Transcripts) package provides 
  tools to purify spatial transcriptomics data using decomposition results from the RCTD 
  (Robust Cell Type Decomposition) algorithm. It offers functionality to adjust cell-type 
  profiles by removing contributions attributed to background contamination. SPLIT also 
  computes contamination scores and estimates local diffusion of contaminating profiles 
  to help distinguish between contamination and phenotypic variation. Additionally, 
  the package includes methods to refine cell-type annotations based on transcriptomic 
  neighborhood homogeneity. The resulting output contains profiles with reduced 
  contamination and increased cell-type specificity.
